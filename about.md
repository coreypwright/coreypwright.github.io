## What I Do
I provide remote, real-time TypeWell transcription services to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, allowing for virtually instantaneous access to spoken content in educational settings and beyond. Captions can be viewed in a browser (via a private URL) on any internet-ready device such as a laptop, smart phone, or tablet. If the meeting is held in Zoom, captions can be straightforwardly integrated into the Zoom window itself. Copies of the complete, meticulously proofread transcripts are made available to you at no additional cost.

## Who I Am
I am a trained TypeWell transcriptionist currently working with a group of wonderful individuals at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology, where we provide captioning and interpreting support for more than a thousand deaf and hard-of-hearing students on our campus.

## Why is this service needed?
Most deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals are not as fortunate as RIT students when it comes to accessibility options. That is why Iâ€™m delighted to expand my horizons and work in a freelance capacity to provide captioning services at an affordable rate to individuals who would otherwise be forced to go without equal access to spoken content as well as organizations who would like to ensure their live content is accessible to all.
