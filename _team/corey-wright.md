Corey has been providing live TypeWell transcription in a university setting for the past four years, but has prided himself on his typing speed ever since 2nd grade computer class.  Without any abbreviation software, he can type 150 words per minute on average, but with TypeWell, well over 200 words per minute.

He received a bachelors degree in linguistics from the State University of New York at Buffalo and has a keen eye for linguistic patterns and collocations which assists him in developing novel shorthand abbreviations for even the most fearsome and arcane academic terminology (though TypeWell's built in dictionary helps a lot, too!).
